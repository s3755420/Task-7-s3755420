		This website is a professional Survey Portfolio of me which was made for the subject Professional Practice (GEOM2116). The website entails information that is academically and professionally related to the field of Surveying. 
		<p>
			A brief introduction about myself. I have experience in diverse surveying environments, am skilled with surveying equipment, detail-oriented, and work well in teams. I efficiently operate survey equipment, gather information, and can handle multiple tasks accurately. I'm seeking a challenging full-time position that utilizes my skills and allows me to pursue professional training for a license.
		</p>
		<p>
			My own personal hobbies outside of Surveying include various outdoor activities, such as Golf and Tennis, I am also an avid reader and enjoy spending time immersed in a good book.

	<div class="academic-intro">
		Cartography consists of creating maps using spatial data obtained from sources such as publicly online government data and population numbers from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics (ABS). While there were multiple assessments in Cartography (not included as it was more of a report rather than a map), the significant
		practical completed in Cartography 2 involved the production of a final map and information poster of the student's choice based on a specific topic:
		<ul>
			<li>Chosen Topic: Map directed at a target audience of choice using provided data from open sources, my chosen topic was to do with Water catchments in the Murray Darling Basin.</li>
			<li>Map Type: The chosen map type was a thematic mapping of a catchments extent of water collection using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Below is the Final Cartographic map that I have created as part of my course:

	<!--SUBJECT 2-->

	<div class="bar"><h2>Surveying Practical Fieldwork</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you gave done yourself-->
	<div class="academic-intro">
		Completing the practical fieldwork for my cadastral surveying course was a significant opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills I had acquired during the course. It served as both a practical test of my abilities and an opportunity to put theoretical concepts into real-world practice. Through this fieldwork, I was able to demonstrate my proficiency in conducting cadastral surveys, incorporating local regulations, and producing accurate and reliable survey data. This experience reinforced my understanding of cadastral surveying principles and enhanced my ability to perform surveying tasks with precision and in compliance with industry standards. 
		</ul>
		<p>
			For the 2022 version of the Cadastral Surveying course which I completed, the main component was about the start to end process of Re-Establishing Property boundaries and Subdivision Design. The main deliverables of the subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Detailed and accurate field cards and successful completion of field data collection, adhering to surveying practices.</li>
			<li>The preparation of hand drawn worksheets, which included all relevant title information and datum computations.</li>
			<li>Drafted plans, such as Plans of Subdivisions, Re-establishments, and Abstract of Field Records.</li>
			<li>Documents such as Surveyors Reports and Datum Descriptions.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			During the field component of my cadastral surveying course, we utilised a Total Station to conduct precise measurements and gather essential data. In the office component, we employed data processing programs like LisCAD and AutoCAD to analyse and manipulate the collected data for accurate mapping and documentation. Throughout the process, we diligently adhered to survey practice directives, ensuring the completion of crucial documents related to title information with precision and compliance with industry standards.

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2023) within the Surveying Industry. For the Last 4 years I have been employed at Head & Humphreys Land Consultants PTY LTD. This page will outline my experience gained and skills I have learned from working within the industry.

	<div class="job-overview">
		During my time at Head & Humphreys Land Consultants, I've accumulated valuable experience as a Survey Technician and Assistant. Over the past four years, I've taken on crucial responsibilities and made substantial contributions to the company's geospatial and surveying operations.
		<p>
			As a Survey Technician since September 2020, my role has revolved around ensuring data accuracy and integrity through daily updates and quality assurance checks. I've honed my skills in operating equipment like Trimble GPS, Leica TS16 & 1205 total stations, and Leica BLK Scanners, which have greatly enhanced my effectiveness in conducting field surveys. Additionally, I've played a pivotal role in training new team members in the use of GIS and GPS software, boosting overall productivity.
		</p>
		One of my standout achievements has been the creation of detailed plans that visually depict boundaries and topographical features. I've also overseen technical data management, collaborated closely with engineers to keep data up-to-date, and diligently maintained the accuracy of archived information in our database. To ensure data precision, I've been thorough in checking and rectifying map errors promptly. Furthermore, I've reviewed surface models by cross-referencing ground control points with field equipment readings, contributing to the precision of our surveying work. In addition to this, I've been responsible for talking with clients and providing information on surveys, boundaries, and related topics.
		</p>
		In my prior role as a Survey Assistant from September 2019 to September 2020, I played a pivotal role in conducting field surveys with the required precision. I consistently cross-checked computations against historical data to ensure data accuracy. My responsibilities extended to researching and monitoring utility locations around project sites, guaranteeing the integrity of project data through daily updates and quality assurance checks, and crafting detailed maps that highlighted boundaries and topographical features.
		</p>
		Throughout both roles, I've adeptly utilised a variety of software tools, including LisCAD and AutoCAD, to compile, organise, and rectify data. I also conducted evaluations of the company's cartography products, assessing their usability and pinpointing areas for enhancement.
		</p>
		My time at Head & Humphreys has furnished me with a solid foundation in surveying technology, techniques, data management, and team leadership. I'm truly committed to advancing my professional development and applying my skills to contribute to the success of future projects and endeavours.
